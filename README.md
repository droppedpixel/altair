# Altair

A text based adventure game for your Mac Terminal.  Written in Swift.  

I discovered ncurses after I began work on this project, which is fine because
this application is meant to be a Swift academic exercise.

The initial commit included a more "classy", Object Oriented approach, including classes
for each of the various objects in the game.  This approach was abandoned early on in
    favor of structures and enumerations.  Admitedly, this was done as an
    academic exercise, but I think it works well.

## Install

Altair is bundled with the <a
href="https://github.com/droppedpixel/altairwrapper">altairwrapper app</a>. 
Drag Altair Wrapper App to Applications folder and launch it the same way
you would any other OS X application.

## Usage

```js

```

## Known issues

There is a tendency for the terminal to flicker when a command
is entered.  I believe this is because the app is not syncd with the screen
refresh, as would be solved by CADisplayLink with UIKit apps.
