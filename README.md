<!--[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/pageres.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/pageres) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sindresorhus/pageres/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/sindresorhus/pageres?branch=master)-->

A text based adventure game for your Mac Terminal.  Written in Swift.  


## Install

Altair is bundled with the <a
href="https://github.com/droppedpixel/altairwrapper">altairwrapper app</a>. 
Drag Altair Wrapper App to Applications folder and launch it the same way
you would any other OS X application.

## Usage

```js

```

## Known issues

There is a tendency for the terminal to flicker when a command
is entered.  I believe this is because the app is not syncd with the screen
refresh, as would be solved by CADisplayLink with UIKit apps.
